Communication between CPN Tools simulator and applet
====================================================

The Java files in this directory can be compiled with J2SE 1.4.2 which
can be downloaded from:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp

The applet in this directory and CPN Tools must be running on the same
computer in order for the communication to work.

To start communiction between the simulator and the applet:
1) Start CPN Tools
2) Load the Sample Net DiningPhilosophers_COMM.cpn
3) Apply the Rewind tool to the net to return to the initial marking 
4) Load the applet on the computer where CPN Tools is running, e.g. by
   double-clicking on the applet.html file
5) Apply the Single Step simulation tool to the Waiting transition
6) Enter 9000 as the Port Number in the GUI for the applet
7) Press the Start button in the applet
8) Run a simulation of the CP-net and observe how the GUI for the
   applet reflects the marking of the CP-net.
